## 1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points

Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

class Solution:
    def maxWidthOfVerticalArea(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        first_value =[]
        difference_list = []

        for point in points:
            first_value.append(point[0])
        sorted_list = sorted(set(first_value))

        for number in range(1, len(sorted_list)):
            difference_list.append(sorted_list[number] - sorted_list[number - 1])

        if len(difference_list) == 0:
            return 0

        return max(difference_list)
