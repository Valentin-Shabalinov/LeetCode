## 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings

You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.

### Example
```
Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.
```
### Solution
```
class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        n = 0
        for i in words:
            if set(i).issubset(set(allowed)):
                n+=1
        return n
```
