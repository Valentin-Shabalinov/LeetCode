## 2186. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram II

You are given two strings s and t. In one step, you can append any character to either s or t.

Return the minimum number of steps to make s and t anagrams of each other.

An anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

### Example
```
Input: s = "leetcode", t = "coats"
Output: 7
```

### Solution
```
class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        for i in s:
            if i in t:
                t=t.replace(i, '', 1)
                s=s.replace(i, '', 1)
        return len(s)+len(t)
```
