## 2427. Number of Common Factors

Given two positive integers a and b, return the number of common factors of a and b.
An integer x is a common factor of a and b if x divides both a and b.

### Example
```
Input: a = 12, b = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.
```
### Solution
```
class Solution:
    def commonFactors(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        a_a=[]
        b_b=[]
        for i in range(1,(a+1)):
            if a%i==0:
                a_a.append(i)
        for i in range(1,(b+1)):
            if b%i==0:
                b_b.append(i)
        return len(set(a_a)&set(b_b))
