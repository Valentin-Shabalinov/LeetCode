## 2942. Find Words Containing Character

You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a character x.
Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character x.
Note that the returned array may be in any order.

### Example
```
Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.
```

### Solution
```
class Solution:
    def findWordsContaining(self, words: List[str], x: str) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize an empty list to store the indices
        indices = []
        # Iterate through the list of words with their indices
        for index, word in enumerate(words):
            # Check if the current word contains the character x
            if x in word:
                # If it does, append the index to the indices list
                indices.append(index)
        # Return the list of indices
        return indices
