## 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

### Example
```
Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
```
### Solution
```
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        f = {c:s.count(c) for c in set(s)}
        r = []
        for key, val in sorted(f.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True):
            r+=key*val
        return ''.join(r)
```
### or
```
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        c = Counter(s)
        ret = ""
        for letter, cnt in c.most_common():
            ret += letter*cnt
        return ret
```
